# Build CI/CD pipeline


### CI/CD Workflow History and Node.js Project Setup

## üß† History of Software Integration

In a typical pre-CI/CD developer workflow, teams worked across multiple branches or feature forks in the same repository. Developers manually ran smoke tests and integration tests locally before pushing changes. This often led to:

- Days or even weeks of delays to test and merge features
- Inconsistent environments
- Delayed feedback and harder debugging

## üöÄ Modern CI/CD Advantages

With automated workflows, integration testing, builds, and deployments now happen within **hours**, enabling **faster, safer merges** into the main branch.

### Continuous Integration Best Practices

- ‚úÖ Automate the build process
- ‚úÖ Run automated tests:
  - Unit tests (minimum requirement)
  - Integration tests
  - UI and end-to-end tests
- ‚úÖ Apply linting for unified code style
- ‚úÖ Perform security checks and scans
  - e.g., [CodeQL](https://github.com/github/codeql) for security scanning

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI for a Node.js Project

- CI should **deploy only to staging**, never directly to production.
- Pull Requests are tested in isolated staging environments before merging into `main`.

### Why Isolated Environments?

In large teams, it's best to **avoid using a shared EC2 instance** for all PRs. Instead:

1. **Spin up a new EC2 instance per PR** using tools like **Terraform**
2. **SSH into the instance**
3. Use `rsync` to copy the build artifacts from the GitHub Actions runner to the EC2 instance
4. Run post-deployment steps like:
   - `npm ci`
   - Restart services (e.g., `pm2`, `nginx`)
   - Run staging tests

---

This setup ensures:
- High environment consistency
- Safe, isolated integration testing
- Smooth transition from PR to production-ready code

## üîê Branch Protection & Code Scanning Strategy

### ‚úÖ Branch Protection Rules

You can enforce rules to maintain code quality and collaboration discipline across your team. 

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Set Up

1. Navigate to your **GitHub Repository**
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Branches**
3. Click **"Add Rule"** under *Branch Protection Rules*
4. Choose the branch name pattern (e.g., `main`)

Common protections for the `main` branch include:

- Require **at least one approval** before merging a pull request
- Require all **status checks to pass** before merging
- Require branches to be **up to date** with the base branch before merging

### Common Status Checks to Add

- `Run Linter`
- `Run Unit Tests`
- `Analyze (JavaScript)` ‚Äì via static analysis tools or CI scanners

## üõ°Ô∏è Code Scanning with CodeQL

[CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/) is a semantic code analysis engine that helps detect security vulnerabilities and bugs in your codebase.

### üîç Strategy for Effective Scanning

- Use **matrix strategy** in your GitHub Actions to define multiple environments or language versions
- Let CodeQL **autobuild** the project automatically
- Run **analysis steps** after build for vulnerability scanning

Example scan stages:
1. **Initialize CodeQL**
2. **Autobuild the application**
3. **Perform analysis**
4. **Upload results to GitHub Security tab**

This setup helps ensure your code is not only clean but secure‚Äîautomatically scanning for known CVEs, unsafe patterns, and logic flaws before merging into production.
